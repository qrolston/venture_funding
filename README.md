## Venture Funding 

Venture Funding (stored as **venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb**) is a multi-function Jupyter Lab notebook to help  predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, using a binary classification model and  a deep neural network.

The Original model was created with 58 hidden layers and displaying a 73.07% accuracy. The first Alternative model was created with 80 hidden layers and 72.56% accuracy. The second Alternative model was created with 40 layers and 73.13% accuracy. Although the lower number of hidden layers is the most accurate all three do maintain a similar accuracy within 1 %

## Technologies

**venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb** is a Jupyter labnotebook with python abilities. It leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* pandas 
* tensorflow
